The website is still being in progress of development, that's why I still haven't hosted it.

Basically it's a website where users can post ad's about cars. They have option to edit, delete as well. A lot of things in the website are customizable ( user profile, ads etc. ). Users can create their own account and start posting ads or if they dont have an account they can still look and search through the ads.
The website has very simple and intuitive design and interface.

I'm using Nuxt3 paired with Firebase as BaaS. 

Some of the things implemented in the website: 

- authentication
- storing images in cloud
- loading states
- crud operations
